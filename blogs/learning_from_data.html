            <h2>List of Weaknesses</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that RL is the solution to a lot more problems/tasks than supervised learning can solve.
                RL, at its core, is the process of making decisions under uncertainty. 
                In contrast, supervised learning is almost by its nature, narrow in scope, as the labels given are for a specific category or task.

                RL is currently good at doing huge raw statistical calculations. 
                This excels in an area that humans aren't good at. 
                However, RL model aren't good at what humans are good at: more general problem solving using different techniques. 
                How do we get RL to get better at more general problem solving?

            <h3>More Than One Way To Approach A Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The reason humans are so good at problem solving is that they can look at different ways of solving a problem. 
                Currently ML only uses one way of problem-solving: statitical methods. 
                In the short term, we can hard-code more ways to problem solve so that there are multiple different types of processes occuring on the same dataset. 
                In the long term, the best solution would be to create an algorithm that discovers new problem-solving methods for itself.
